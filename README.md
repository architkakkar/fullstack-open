```

Each folder corresponds to a part of the course and contains its related exercises and projects.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/architkakkar/fullstack-open.git
   cd fullstack-open
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific part you want to run:
   ```bash
   cd partX
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server (for frontend projects using Vite):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. For backend projects, start the server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

6. For React Native projects, follow the specific setup instructions for running the project on your development environment.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Redux, React Native, TypeScript, Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB, Relational Databases (e.g., PostgreSQL)
- **Testing**: Jest, Cypress
- **State Management**: Redux, React Context
- **API**: RESTful APIs, GraphQL
- **DevOps**: CI/CD pipelines, Docker containers

## Learning Outcomes

- Building dynamic and responsive user interfaces with React and React Native
- Managing application state effectively using Redux and React Context
- Implementing RESTful APIs and GraphQL for backend services
- Testing applications to ensure reliability
- Connecting frontend applications to backend servers and databases
- Writing scalable and type-safe code using TypeScript
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines and containerizing applications with Docker
- Deploying applications using containerization tools
- Utilizing relational databases in modern web applications
